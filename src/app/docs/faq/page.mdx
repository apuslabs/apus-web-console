## How to Open Port 9000 on Linux

Opening a port on Linux can be achieved by adjusting your system's firewall rules. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to open port 9000, which is commonly needed for services like the Apus Marketplace node to function correctly.

### Using `iptables`

If your Linux distribution uses `iptables` as the default firewall, you can open port 9000 with the following command:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9000 -j ACCEPT
```

To make this rule persistent across reboots, save the iptables rules with:

```bash
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

### Using firewalld
For systems using firewalld, you can open port 9000 by typing:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=9000/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

This command adds a rule to the public zone to allow TCP traffic on port 9000, and the --reload option applies the changes without needing to restart the firewall service.

### Using ufw
If you are using ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall), the process is straightforward:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 9000/tcp
```

And then enable the changes by reloading ufw:

```bash
sudo ufw reload
```

### Verification

After opening the port, you can verify that it is open by running:

```bash
sudo iptables -L -v
```

Or, if you're using firewalld:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

Or for ufw:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

Choose the command based on which firewall management tool your Linux distribution uses. The verification step should show that port 9000 is now allowed.

> Note: Always ensure that your system's security is not compromised when opening ports. Only open ports that you need and understand the potential risks involved.

## How to View Your Earnings
### Checking Earnings on the Platform Dashboard
To monitor your earnings, navigate to the platform's dashboard and access the "Earnings" section. This page provides a comprehensive view of your income and transaction history within the platform.

### Viewing APE/ETH Earnings in MetaMask
If you're holding APE tokens or earning through Ethereum-related activities, you can keep track of your assets using the MetaMask wallet. To ensure that your APE tokens are visible in MetaMask, you may need to add them manually:

<Button type="primary" onClick={addAPEToken} className="mb-2">Add APE Token</Button>

Ensure you have the MetaMask extension installed and are logged in to your wallet before adding the token.

## Why do i need to bridge my eth to taiko chain

### Enhanced Speed and Lower Costs
Taiko Chain is a Layer 2 (L2) solution, specifically a Type-1 L2 chain, which is designed to operate more efficiently than the Ethereum mainnet. By bridging your ETH to Taiko Chain, you will likely experience:

- **Reduced Transaction Fees**: Taiko Chain's structure allows for lower gas fees compared to executing transactions directly on the Ethereum mainnet.
- **Faster Transactions**: Taiko Chain processes transactions at a higher speed, meaning you can send and receive assets more quickly.

### Integration with Apus Marketplace
Apus Marketplace is an innovative decentralized platform that operates on the Taiko Chain. By bridging your ETH to Taiko, you can seamlessly:

- **Trade Digital Assets**: Buy and sell digital goods using a marketplace designed for rapid and cost-effective transactions.
- **Participate in the Ecosystem**: Engage with a thriving community and utilize decentralized applications (dApps) built on Taiko Chain.

This revision aims to clarify the instructions and provide additional context for the benefits of bridging to Taiko Chain, making the information more digestible for users who may be new to the web3 space.
