## Tokenomics

In the Apus Marketplace, we have deployed our test tokens on **Taiko's Layer 2 (L2)** to facilitate rewarding participants.

### Earnings Statuses

When you complete proof within our system, they will pass through various statuses:

- **`Created`**: The proof is initialized and is waiting to be picked up.
- **`Assigned`**: The proof is **actively being worked on** by the assignee.
- **`Submitted`**: Proof is **finished** and has been **submitted for verification**.
- **`Paid`**: The compensation for the proof has **been issued** to the participant's wallet.
- **`Penalized`**: A penalty has been imposed on the task due to failure to meet the required standards or missing deadlines.

It's important to note that earnings will only be disbursed when the task status is **`Paid`**.

### Reward Structure

Rewards are granted for **successfully verified** proofs, and they vary based on the type of task completed. The current rewards on Taiko are disbursed in either `ETH` or `TTKOJ` tokens. In addition to these, participants will also receive Apus Eagle tokens (`APE`).

The Apus Eagle token serves as an additional incentive and operates alongside the primary rewards. The distribution of `APE` tokens is designed to encourage continued participation and excellence in task completion within the Apus ecosystem.
