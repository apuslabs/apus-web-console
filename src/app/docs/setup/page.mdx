# Join Apus

## Step 1: Clone the Starter Template

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone -b apus-simple-taiko-node https://github.com/apuslabs/simple-taiko-node.git
```

This command clones the starter template to your local machine.

## Step 2: Update the Configuration File

Navigate to the cloned directory

```bash
cd simple-taiko-node
vi .env
```

Update Environment Variables on demand. Usually, you don't need to update the following variables.

```shell
# Set the maximum number of tasks you can accept at the same time
ZKEVM_CHAIN_INSTANCES_NUM=1
# Set the maximum number of ZKEVM instances you can run at the same time
MAX_ZKEVM_INSTANCE=1
```
Save and exit the file.

## Step 3: Run the Docker Container

Execute the following command to start the service:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This command will deploy the container in detached mode.

**make sure your port 9000 is accessible**

if your port 9000 is closed, you can update the port in `docker-compose.yml`
```yml
services:
  zkevm_chain_prover_rpcd:
    ports:
      - 0.0.0.0:9001:9000
```

## Step 4: Check Logs

To view the logs, use:
```bash
docker logs -f simple-taiko-node_zkevm_chain_prover_rpcd_1
```

When you see the following message, it means your node is ready to accept tasks:
```
[2023-12-01T03:35:03Z INFO  prover::server] Listening on http://0.0.0.0:9000
```
When you see the following message, it means your node is generating proof:

> **Your Client URL is http://127.0.0.1:9000**
> *if you update the port, you should use the port you set*
